	<p>The eerie night crept under my skin and sent shivers through my spine. Eleanor stood behind me, her silhouette hovered over me.  “Are you sure?” Her trembling voice quaked. “Yes”, I replied. Under the dimly lit street lamps, we carefully made our way through the silent city of San Francisco. Around us houses were drenched in sleep. In her hand was a note, crumpled by her sweaty nervous palms: Jane Asher</p>

	<p>It’s been seventeen days since I last heard her mellow voice. The voice that mentioned the simplest aspects of life. The placid waves, the blue sky, and even the way somehow, everything fits together. This didn’t. As I watched Eleanor nervously uncrumple the paper, I whispered. “What if we can’t find her? They’ve tried everything.” She returned the note to her pocket. “Everything is not enough.” As I placed my hand in Eleanor’s, we shined our torches ahead, into the path we’ve walked sixteen times before.</p>

As my weary eyes adjusted to the blend of light and dark across the Golden Gate Bridge, the outline of a tall slender man came into focus. He was coated in an ominous green leather jacket and a worn out rucksack slumped on the concrete beside his feet. He was facing the tranquil waves as they caved into the soft sand below. Maybe he’s just enjoying a moment alone, I thought. His eyes were shut tight and his chest breathing heavily as Eleanor and I slowly approached. In that instant, the man leaped onto the metal fence, bordering the bridge and a cool misty atmosphere of the unknown. He tilted forward and was about to lose his balance…</p>
